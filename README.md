Bubble Shooter

Bubble shooters are a common type of arcade / mobile game. If you’re not familiar with the genre, we suggest you spend a small amount of time familiarizing yourself with how these games work by finding examples on Google Play, the Apple App Store, or online. Find at least 2 different implementations so you can compare different approaches.
A functional bubble shooter should at least contain the following elements:

* A hexagonal grid of bubbles
* A ceiling to which the bubbles are attached
* A cannon or similar element from which the bubbles are fired
* Slots to display both the current and the next bubble to be fired
* Firing a bubble that connects with at least 2 other bubbles of the same color creates
a match, popping those 3+ connected bubbles
* Any bubbles that become detached from the ceiling and the rest of the bubble grid
should be dropped and then popped, so there are never any floating bubbles

Endless Runner

Endless runners are another common type of arcade / mobile game. Find at least 2 examples of runners online or in app stores to use as references before you start.

A functional runner should at least contain the following elements:
* An infinitely scrolling background or parallax
* A running character who can jump
* A scrolling floor or set of platforms on which the character runs
* A score that represents how well the player is performing
* A set of obstacles or pits that cause the player to lose the game
* A set of collectible items or power­ups that help the player stay alive or increase the
player’s score
